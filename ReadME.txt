Concept: 
Even though in The US soccer is not a very popular sport, The World Cup is the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world.  Analysis estimates approximately 3.5 billion people watched the 2018 tournament in Russia.

For this project we wanted to visualize the history of the tournament, adding dynamic and static elements, to better tell the story.

We will answer the following questions.

•	Who played the final match in a given year, and what was the result? 
•	What countries have been winners and runner-ups during the history of the cup?
•	How many spectators each were at the final games?
•	Who are to top players in the world?
 

The webpage:

In order to answer the four different question we develop a webpage with the following characteristics:
o	A drop down menu where the user can select a year, that will drive Insights regarding the final match
o	A leaflet map to visualize the match and tooltips to display details
o	Dynamic titles to explain the map
o	D3 charts to visualize winners though the history of the tournament
o	D3 charts to visualize attendance to the final matches.
o	Js High charts to visualize top players in the world. 

Components:

For the competition of this projects we use the following technologies:

2. A database with the required data 

3. A flask application with routes that return Json data to be used on the webpage.

4. Java script code to bind charts, data and flask.

5. Heroku app.
